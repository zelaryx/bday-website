                <h1>Happy Birthday <3</h1>
                <p class="letter-contents">to my babe: <br><br>
                    happy 21st! i bet you've been waiting for this moment all your life hahah.
                    now you can finally skip the long drive to pantry and just go across the street to county to get your alc fix.
                    even though you'll probably still take Toad (lazy ass)...<br><br>

                    it's crazy how just a year ago, you were a complete stranger to me, and now you hold
                    such a significant place in my heart :0 now i get to witness and celebrate one of the important milestones in your life.
                    from now on, i'm excited to celebrate each passing year with you, and grow and mature with you. i know you said you've
                    never been big on birthday celebrations before, from now on i want to make you feel as special as possible on your
                    birthday. i want you to know how glad i am that you were born this day so many years ago. you, my best friend and biggest
                    fan, but also my biggest hater... <br><br>

                    i know we may have our disagreements and our different ways of expressing love but yk what? i still accept it all. i love
                    the person you were born as and i promise i'll love you for a long time (unless you like cheat on me or try to kill me or
                    something but i know ofc you won't do that LOL). and i promise i'll always accept you and care for you even if you change,
                    especially as you change, because i think that's really what it means to love someone. <br><br>
                    
                    i don't need reasons why i love you, like how we are just so comfortable around each other, or your sense of humor and how
                    you laugh at the dumbest things and i find that so cute, or how you're trying to love me the way i want to be loved too.
                    i mean, yeah, all of these are what make our relationship, but at the end of the day i will still love you even if you don't
                    laugh at the same childish jokes anymore or even if one day we may stop being stupid around each other and being comfortable
                    doing so.<br><br>
                    
                    i just simply love you because you are you. i choose you as my person, and you will always deserve to be loved.<br><br>

                    so, today's all about celebrating you! i hope you have an amazing day and enjoy your last day at home, and once you get back
                    to chicago we'll celebrate you with me there this time. i haven't seen you in ages and i can't wait to see you tomorrow heheh
                    <br><br>

                    i love you bb. have the best 21st birthday.<br><br><br>
